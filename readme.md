#A house scraper
This is my first scraper project, created for now to export to excel and monitor prices... eventually to an SQL server
and have it automate emails for price alerts.

Utilizes Gecko Driver to scrape every page of a site, unfortunately it uses live script so have to use the driver.

Thanks to Mr. Ayub for the initial help with the scraping.
